This is a skeleton template for a Rust project. Please find all the documentation here and the source code [here](https://github.com/nokx5/golden-rust).

> **NOTE:** you may require the experimental flakes commands `nix build` and `nix shell` in the following. If you do not, only classic nix commands `nix-build` and `nix-shell` will be available.

## My development tools are
- nix :snowflake: (packaging from hell :heart:)
  - *with [rust-overlay](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay) for targeted binary distributed rust toolchains*
  - rustup (ðŸ¦€ toolchain installer)
  - cargo (package manager)
- rustfmt (formatter)
- vscode (IDE) with
  - matklad.rust-analyzer
  - vadimcn.vscode-lldb
- [useful crates](https://lib.rs/development-tools/testing) (tests)
- rustdoc (documentation)

## Use the software

The [nokxpkgs](https://github.com/nokx5/nokxpkgs#add-nokxpkgs-to-your-nix-channel) channel and associate overlay can be imported with the `-I` command or by setting the `NIX_PATH` environment variable.

```bash
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/nokx5/nokxpkgs/archive/main.tar.gz -p golden-rust --command cli_golden
# or
nix shell github:nokx5/golden-rust --command cli_golden
nix shell github:nokx5/nokxpkgs#golden-rust --command cli_golden
```
## Develop the software (depreciated - new hash)

> Please note that all commands of this section creates new hashes which means that the evaluation may require additional downloads.

Start by cloning the [git repository](https://github.com/nokx5/golden-rust) locally and enter it.

#### Option 1: Develop the software (minimal requirements)

You can develop or build the local software easily with the minimal requirements.

```bash
# option a: develop with a local shell (depreciated - new hash)
nix-shell --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./derivation.nix {src = ./.; }'

# option b: build the local project (depreciated - new hash)
nix-build --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./derivation.nix {src = ./.; }' --no-out-link
```

Note that you can write the nix expression directly to the `default.nix` file to avoid typing `--expr` each time.

#### Option 2: Develop the software (supercharged :artificial_satellite:)

You can enter the supercharged environment for development.

```bash
nix-shell shell.nix # (depreciated - new hash)
```

## Develop the software

> **NOTE:** This section requires the experimental `flake` and `nix-command` features. Please refer to the official documentation for nix flakes. The advantage of using nix flakes is that you avoid channel pinning issues.
> 
> After Nix was installed, update to the unstable feature with:
> 
> ```bash
> nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nixUnstable
> ```
> 
> And enable experimental features with:
> 
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
> echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
> ```

Start by cloning the [git repository](https://github.com/nokx5/golden-rust) locally and enter it.

#### Option 1: Develop the software

```bash
# option a: develop with a local shell
nix develop .#golden-rust
# or
nix-shell . -A packages.x86_64-linux.golden-rust

# option b: build the local project
nix build .#golden-rust
# or
nix-build . -A packages.x86_64-linux.golden-rust
```

#### Option 2: Develop the software (supercharged :artificial_satellite:)

You can enter the supercharged development environment.

```bash
nix develop
# or
nix-shell . -A devShell.x86_64-linux
```

## Code Snippets

One line code formatter for C/C++ projects

```bash
nixpkgs-fmt .

rustfmt $(find -name "*.rs")
```
